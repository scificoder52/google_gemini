# Gemini Clone Project ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Gemini Clone** project! This is not just a functional AI model but also a personal learning journey where I explored key development skills like toggling between light/dark modes, integrating with APIs, and utilizing local storage.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

Through this project, I developed a deeper understanding of:

1. **Dark Mode / Light Mode Toggling**:
   - Learned how to switch themes dynamically using JavaScript and CSS.
   - Utilized local storage to save user preferences for theme selection.

2. **Interacting with Gemini-like APIs**:
   - Understood how to send HTTP requests (e.g., `fetch`) and handle API responses.
   - Learned to manage authentication tokens and handle errors gracefully.

3. **Local Storage**:
   - Gained knowledge of how to persist user data locally.
   - Used local storage for saving theme preferences and API response history.
